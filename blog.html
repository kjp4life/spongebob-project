                            <p> <b><font size='30'>L</font></b>et me tell you a story about how I effortlessly became the King of Karate! There might even be a moral to this story, for those of you into this sort of thing. It was a sunny day in Bikini Bottom, life was wavy as usual. Squidward was probably struggling to tune his clarinet when he really should be tuning his skills. Patrick was probably rock gazing somewhere as he is prone to do. I was giving Gary the wax of his life, when all of a sudden the mailman dropped off a videotape delivery. I popped it in my TV, and lo and behold: someone recognized my talent as an <i>artiste</i> of the martial arts, deserving the title King of Karate. I couldn't pass the chance to share this with my sparring partner in crime Sandy. She seemed suspicious of the whole thing (jealous most likely), and offered to accompany me to Karate Island.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Upon arrival on the island, we were greeted by the guru Master Udon. He greeted me with the reverence I deserved of course, as Sandy sulked over him ignoring her. What a sourpuss! I immediately asked Master Udon to fight his best guards. A sponge has to warm up, ya know? Three guards came in, and I barely touched them before they went down. Pfft, barely worth my time. Udon officially crowns me, I sit on my throne, and grant Sandy the honor of a chair by my side. She proceeds to tell me this feels like a scam. Can you believe her? I call her out on her jealousy, she gets mad and storms off. Right as she leaves, shackles come out of my throne and restrain me. Uh-oh. Saaaaandyyyyy, help!</p>
                            <p>Lucky for me, Sandy is a better friend than I am. Heeding my cries, she fought Udon's real guards in his Tower to come save me, mortal combat style. Each floor she had to go through had a fearsome opponent with unique abilities. One tried to tickle her to death, the other tried to smack her with her long lips, the third almost took her out with his stench! She proceeds to fight Master Udon last, who proved to be the strongest of all. Fast forward to the point where she saves me and we're off the island, I apologized for being a jerk, and being a real friend, Sandy forgave me. Ah...Karate Island...Good times, good times.</p>

                            <p> <b><font size='30'>B</font></b>eing a sidekick is no joke. You'd think the main role is to let the hero do most of the work, and occasionally throw a corny catchphrase to keep the crown entertained. But no, we learned that the hard way when Mermaid Man had the brillian idea to put together a last minute team of us amateurs with absolutely zero team synergy. Teamwork makes the dream work is all fun and games until you're trusting your teammate to not burn you with their lava superpowers (sorry Squidward, but I'm still not over it). We had the villains trembling in fear and asking for our mercy, but instead they should have propped up some lawn chairs, grabbed some popcorn, and yelled for an encore. Pathetic is the word of the day. This might sound like a bunch of hoopla to you our readers, and you're probably wondering how we got there. Well, let's dig in.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>It begins like any other superhero dilemma: big bad villains join forces, the city is doomed if we don't stop them bla bla. Mermaid man assembles the International Justice League of Super Acquaintances (give me a break, this was last second), and casually gives us superpowered costumes with no training and instruction manuals. What could go wrong? After a brief meeting on the situation, which I forgot all about once he brought out the pizza, we left to take down the EVIL league. This is about the time everything went downhill.</p>
                            <p>Before I explain the carnage, let me give you a breakdown of the League: we have The Quickster (your favorite superspeedy Sponge at your service), Captain Magma (with Squidward's hot head), The Elastic Waistband (stretchy Patrick), Miss Appear (Sandy goes invisible), and Mermaid Man of course. The fight lasted an embarrassing <b>minute</b>, starting with Squidward erupting on me and essentially melting me. Patrick tried to save me but overstretch and got all tangled up. Squidward then gets hit with Mermaid Man's water ball by accident and got quenched. Sandy went invisible and went for the sneak attack, only to get hit by a car, propelling her off a cliff. Mermaid Man gave up right after. Defeated ourselves to own EVIL. Take that!</p>
