                            <p>Here I was, hanging out at the Krusty Krab. Then I saw Plankton creeping up with the secret formula. I saw the punk thinking he's slick and decided I would show him I am beyond his simple tricks. I grabbed my spatula, took a patty, and flung that thing at him like an Assassin's Creed trebuchet. And lo and behold, here was my satisfaction when he got bodied by a patty and slammed against the door.</p>

                            <p>Let me tell you a story about how I effortlessly became the King of Karate! It was a sunny day in Bikini Bottom, I was giving Gary the wax of his life, when all of a sudden the mailman dropped off a videotape delivery. I popped it in my TV, and lo and behold: someone recognized my talent as an <i>artiste</i> of the martial arts, deserving the title of Kingo of Karate. I couldn't pass the chance to share this with my sparring partner in crime Sandy. She seemed suspicious of the whole thing (jealous most likely), and offered to accompany me to Karate Island.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Upon arrival on the island, we were greeted by the guru Master Udon. He greeted me with the reverence I deserved of course, as Sandy sulked over him ignoring her. What a sourpuss! I immediately asked Master Udon to fight his best guards. A sponge has to warm up, ya know? Three guards came in, and I barely touched them before they went down. Pfft, barely worth my time. Udon officially crowns me, I sit on my throne, and grant Sandy the honor of a chair by my side. She proceeds to tell me this feels like a scam. Can you believe her? I call her out on her jealousy, she gets mad and storms off. Right as she leaves, shackles come out of my throne and restrain me. Uh-oh. Saaaaandyyyyy, help!</p>
                            <p>Lucky for me, Sandy is a better friend than I am. Heeding my cries, she fought Udon's real guards in his Tower to come save me, mortal combat style. Each floor she had to go through had a fearsome opponent with unique abilities. One tried to tickle her to death, the other tried to smack her with her long lips, the third almost took her out with his stench! She proceeds to fight Master Udon last, who proved to be the strongest of all. Fast forward to the point where she saves me and we're off the island, I apolgized for being a jerk, and being a real friend, Sandy forgave me. Ah...Karate Island...Good times, good times. </p>
