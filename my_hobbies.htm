Jelly fishing is one of my favorite hobbies. I always go jellyfishing with my best friend Patrick near Jellyfish fields.
There are a wide variety of jellyfish swimming around such as the common pink jellyfish, the lucrative blue jellyfish, and her magesty the queen jellyfish.
It can be a bit tricky to catch your first jellyfish so i always rememebr the teachings of Patrick. His best advice is to always firmly grasp your net.</td>

I love to blow bubbles with Patrick whenever im free. The feeling of blowing air and creating fantastinc shapes is wonderful and exciting.
I have even made a friend called Bubble Buddy when all my freinds were busy. Blowing bubbles takes time and practice to become a bubble blowing champion.
The bubble-blowing technique has 9 steps:

<ol>
<li>Lift your leg up behind you</li>
<li>Spin around for about a second</li>
<li>Stop</li>
<li>Double take 3 times.</li>
<li>Pelvic thrust to your left, then back to your right</li>
<li>Stop on your right foot (Don't forget it!)</li>
<li>"Bring it around town" by spinning your torso in a circle around the air</li>
<li>Do this, and that, and this, and that, this and that, this and that,(Jump around for about 6 seconds)</li>
<li>Blow your bubble lightly for detailed extravagant art</li>
</ol>

I love to preform songs and dance with all my friends. Being able to sing about how today was the best day ever or preforming at the superbowl makes my heart melt.
I even helps pass the time, especially when delivering Krusty Krab pizzas.
Music alsways makes me feel better on my worst days like the time I ripped my pants or when Gary ran away from home. It has even helped Plankton learn how to have fun.</td>

I am really skilled at Karate. I practice all the time Sandy. Although, she maybe stronger than me, i was the one who was invited to Karate Island to become The King Of Karate.
Practicig with Sandy has definetly made me stronger and keeps me thinking of new ways to sneak up on Sandy. Safety is always important so I always keep my red karate gear clean
and in tip top shape.
