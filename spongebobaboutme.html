    <div class="a">
      <p> The Krusty Krab has been my place of work for over twenty years now. It is my home away from home, although
        Mr. Krabs said I cannot
        live here. I thought "Wouldn't it be such great idea if you guys can here about what goes on at the Krusty Krab,
        (Bikini Bottom's
        Number One restaurant), from time to time!" So, this is if for you, and Squiqward. He misses work a lot so I
        thought I'd give him updates!
        I wonder why that is? Below are some of my favorite photos from work. Scroll down to read about my days at work!

        <p> <b>Krabs wanted me to come to work earlier today. I was up nice and early to make sure my pet snail Gary
            had enough food to
            eat. When I got to the Krusty Krab, it was time for a surprise pop quiz on the Krusty Krab. I would tell
            you how it went,
            but the answers are top secret. Later, my best friend Patrick came to visit me, but it seems like all he
            did was eat the
            entire restaurant. The furniture included. Once a Krabby Patty is in his face, it's hard to get his
            attention back.<b> </p>

        <p><b> Later, Mr. Krabs gave me the honor of cleaning the grease traps in the kitchen. Could you beleive it,
            all for me? There, I
            found a few bits of burnt-up Krabby Patty. I decided to lump them all together and make a new pet to play
            with, I call him
            Bitsy. It seems like time flew right on by because I noticed it was the end of the day soon after. Mr.
            Krabs let me leave
            15 seconds early today. I told him I'll make up the time by working three overtime shifts next week, at
            half the pay! <b></p>

          <p> <b>Today was the best day of work today! One of my closest friends Sandy Cheeks came to the Krusty Krab
              today. She came to show
              me her new invention, the new KarateBot 5000. It is the ultimate master at Karate. I don't even think
              Sandy could defeat it.
              Below is a picture of her from today. Little does she know that I already have plan up my sleeve. Beside
              that, I got a massive
              order today. It was like Christmas. Someone named Shelly P. Lankton ordered 1,000 Krabby Patties. I hope
              he enjoys them, I made
              sure I gave each a special kiss to leave a mark of my love of Patties.<b> </p>

          <div class="a">
            <p><b> 99.99% of the time, going to work is the best place to be in Sea. I love to work for Mr. Krabs, and I
                am the best frycook that the
                Bikini Bottom has ever seen. Today was that 0.01%. I still love Mr. Krabs, but he said something to me
                that left me almost in tears.
                I go to work, with a great attitude every day, ready to serve the customers with the utmost joy. Mr.
                Krabs disagrees. He thinks that
                while it is good that I am close with the customers, I am getting too personal and that I need to tone
                it down. This made me sad
                because The Krusty Krab is my second home, and I love everyone dearly. To say that I can't do that is
                the hardest thing I may ever
                have to do.<b></p>

            <p><b> Working with Squidward, though, does cheer me up. He really is fun to play with. Today, I pretended
                to be a French Chef while
                Squidward was an angry patron. Well he might of just been angry. Later, he saw me upset after what Krabs
                said, and he tried to comfort
                me by telling me Krabs is a cheapstake old meanie. I said "Hey, don't say that about Mr. Krabs. He's the
                greatest boss we will ever
                have." Squidward walked away and took his break after I said that. Now that I think of, Mr. Krabs was
                only trying to help me at work.
                He would never say anything to me that wouldn't help the Krusty Krab. With that in mind, I will try to
                work on being too invasive.<b></p>

            <p><b> My first entry! What can I say. I want to thank my best friend Patrick, who told me I should start
                writing about the Krusty Krab.
                I want to thank Sandy for helping me write out my ideas. A special thank you to Mr. Krabs for giving me
                this job so that I can write
                about it. I want to thank Squidward for being the best cashier anyone could work with. I want to thanks
                my mom and dad, who told me
                to accomplish everything it is I want to do. I also want to congratulate the bus driver for getting me
                to work on time every morning,
                Old Man Jenkins for being a great customer and support, Mrs. Puff, Larry the Lobster, Mermaid Man and
                Barnacle Boy, The Flying
                Dutchman, all the passerbys. Lastly, the pickle jars that never get changed out at work. They're always
                there for me. Hmmm, am I
                forgetting anyone? Oh, I don't want anyone to think I forgot them. Well now that I got that out of the
                way, I want to write my first
                journal entry about work. Here it goes.<b></p>
